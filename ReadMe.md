# Celestia locations maker (CLM)
A Python script that creates location files for Celestia in SSC format from [Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/) database.

## How to use it?
You need Python 3.6 or higher (due to f-strings) and probably Windows. The script doesn't require an Internet connection because the [database](SearchResults) is preloaded.

Run [clm.py](clm.py), select the object and file name. Done. In case of problems, the script will notify you.

## How to update the database file?
1. Go to [Planetary Names: Advanced Nomenclature Search](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/AdvancedSearch);
2. Check all the boxes in `Columns to include`;
3. Choose `Output Format` as `TSV`;
4. Do `Search` and save the file.

## What else do I need to know?
- By default, the tool is designed for the Celestia 1.7 and Celestia Origin, which support all existing [types of locations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Celestia/SSC_File#Type_%22string%22). To create SSC for Celestia 1.6, set `celestia16` flag to `True`.
- By default, the script adds to SSC comments about the location type, dates of creation and last update, as well as information about the origin of the name. To disable this feature, set `comments` flag to `False`.
- Names of `AL`, `ME`, `OC`, `RE` and `TA` location types are written in capital letters.
- For albedo features with an unknown size, `Importance` sets to 20. For other location types, `Size` sets to 10.
- The IAU in the location database uses the [Vesta coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta#Coordinate_systems) with an offset of 150Â° relative to the *Dawn* team system. Since Celestia Origin uses the model based on the second coordinate system, this shift is hardcoded.

## Roadmap
- The database contains 333 locations with zero sizes. The record holders are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Rhea, Titan and Triton. I made a version of the script that displays all dimensionless locations on the maps of the corresponding bodies. I hope we can fix them.
- It is possible to create an algorithm that will determine the height of a location using an elevation map. This is important for non-ellipsoidal bodies such as Vesta.
